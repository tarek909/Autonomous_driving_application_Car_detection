Detecting Objects in images by You Only Look Once ( YOLO ) Algorithm to help in autonomous driving applications <br/>
The input is an image taken by a self-driving car, the output is the boundary boxes of detected objects. 

### YOLO <br />
Yolo is a popular algorithm in computer vision used to recognize objects in an image. It can be used to make real-time predictions.


### Boundary Boxes <br />
Boundary boxes is the output of YOLO algorithm. They contain information like what is the detected object, Probability, and co-ordinates of the object.
